### Implementation Notes:

*   **Tone:** Hopeful, empowering, inclusive, and action-oriented.
*   **Visuals:** The background should be a subtle, inspiring image or video (e.g., a sunrise, a path forward, a gentle ocean). It should evoke a sense of new beginnings without being overly dramatic.
*   **Layout:** The headline should be the most prominent element. The sub-headline provides the context, and the two CTAs offer clear, distinct choices for the user.
