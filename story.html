        <h2>The Story in 60 Seconds</h2>
        <p>Bob Burr's mother died when he was 12. He earned his GED at 17, served 6 years in the Navy, led an organization that received the Presidential 1000 Points of Light Award, built a multi-million dollar business over 20 years, spent 15 years as Chaplain and Educator inside Federal/State prisons, directed GraceHouse to a <strong>7-8% recidivism rate</strong> (vs. the state's 55-60%), built Digital Grandpa to 2,847 members organically—and now launches Beacon Momentum in Q1 2026 to scale those proven frameworks globally through AI-powered technology.</p>

        <h2>Military Foundation (1979-1987)</h2>
        
        <h3>Early Loss and Self-Made Foundation</h3>
        <p><strong>1974:</strong> Bob's mother died from cancer when he was 12 years old. Family tragedy necessitated leaving formal education. He spent the next 5 years working and preparing for independence.</p>

        <p><strong>August 1979:</strong> Earned GED at age 17 through self-directed education after his mother's death. The GED qualified him to enlist in the Navy as a "graduate."</p>

        <h3>Navy Service & Development</h3>
        <p><strong>Late November 1980:</strong> Turned 18, entered US Navy</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>US Navy Active Duty:</strong> Late 1980 - October 1985 (4 years)</li>
            <li><strong>US Navy Reserve:</strong> October 1985 - October 1987 (2 years)</li>
            <li><strong>Total:</strong> 6 years of Navy service</li>
            <li><strong>Discharge:</strong> Honorable discharge with commendations</li>
            <li><strong>Foundation:</strong> Leadership training, discipline, service mindset</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="pullquote">
            "Bob's journey didn't start with advantages—it started with losing his mother at 12 and having to leave formal education to survive. The GED wasn't a backup plan; it was self-determination. The Navy wasn't just service; it was a pathway out after family tragedy. Everything Bob built came from having nothing, losing everything early, and choosing to rebuild. This is why he can speak to anyone who's lost it all—he's been doing it since age 12."
        </div>

        <h2>Business Success (Mid-1980s - 2003)</h2>

            <li>Integrated faith, business, and community service throughout</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Note on Documentation:</strong> Bob's business records for Pinnacle Insurance Agency were seized by government entities 1999-2001—years before his 2002 arrest. No financial documentation remains. What remains is Bob's lived experience and the operational excellence demonstrated through 51 years of subsequent leadership across military, NGO, business, and ministry sectors.</p>

        <h2>Global NGO Leadership (1990s)</h2>

            "Bob didn't visit prisons. He lived inside them for 15 years. He knows what it's like to lose everything, to be written off by society, and to rebuild from absolute zero. That's not theory. That's lived experience."
        </div>

        <h2>GraceHouse (2017-2021)</h2>
        
        <h3>The Numbers That Matter</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>7-8% recidivism rate</strong> under Bob's directorship</li>
            <li><strong>State average: 55-60%</strong> return to incarceration within 5 years</li>
            <li><strong>Bob's success: 92-93% stayed free</strong> (vs. state's 40-45%)</li>
            <li><strong>Scaled from 0 to 30 beds across 7 properties</strong> in 4 years</li>
            <li><strong>GraceHouse still operating</strong> under new board leadership</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>How Bob Did It:</strong> Structured re-entry program combining housing, employment support, peer accountability, trauma recovery, and spiritual foundation. No government funding. No grants. Just proven frameworks that worked.</p>

        <h2>Digital Grandpa (2022-2025)</h2>
        
        <h3>Proving the Model Organically</h3>
        <p>After stepping down from GraceHouse, Bob returned to New England and reconnected with his son John (now 33, they share weekly meals). He created Digital Grandpa—a mentorship platform for men 40-70 rebuilding after major life transitions.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>2,847 members</strong> built organically (no paid ads, no venture capital)</li>
            <li><strong>156,000+ collective days of sobriety</strong> tracked in the community</li>
            <li><strong>Wisdom-based guidance</strong> from someone who's lived it all</li>
            <li><strong>Peer-driven community</strong> of men supporting each other</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Digital Grandpa proved the demand for Bob's frameworks. Now Beacon Momentum scales those frameworks to serve three distinct audiences through AI-powered infrastructure.</p>

        <h2>Beacon Momentum (2026+)</h2>
        
        <h3>Three Pathways, One Mission</h3>
        <p>Beacon Momentum launches Q1 2026 with three distinct pathways:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Beacon Rise:</strong> "Reclaim Your Life After Transition" - Rebuilders (40s-70s) navigating major life transitions</li>
            <li><strong>Beacon Launch:</strong> "Build Your Business, Own Your Future" - Next generation entrepreneurs (25-45)</li>
            <li><strong>Beacon Academy:</strong> "Master DeFi & Modern Finance" - Educators teaching DeFi/modern finance</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Business Model:</strong> Dual revenue streams (membership + backend services) create sustainable, scalable impact. AI-powered support ensures 24/7 availability. Peer-driven community ensures it outlasts the founder.</p>

        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        
        <h3>Unique Positioning</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Achieved 7-8X better outcomes</strong> (7-8% recidivism vs. 55-60% state average)</li>
            <li><strong>Presidential validation</strong> before the fall (character proven at highest level)</li>
            <li><strong>Complete life experience</strong> (top → bottom → back up)</li>
            <li><strong>51 years of service</strong> (not 2-3 years like most gurus)</li>
            <li><strong>Operational scale</strong> (30 beds, 7 properties proves he can execute)</li>
            <li><strong>Built to last</strong> (GraceHouse still operates after Bob stepped down)</li>
        </ul>
