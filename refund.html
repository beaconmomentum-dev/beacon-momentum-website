        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 29, 2025</p>
        
        <div class="intro">
            <p><strong>We stand behind our programs.</strong> This Refund Policy outlines the terms and conditions under which refunds are available for Beacon Momentum programs, services, and memberships. Please read this policy carefully before making a purchase.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. General Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>Beacon Momentum offers refunds under specific circumstances as outlined below. All refund requests are subject to review and approval. We reserve the right to deny refunds that do not meet the criteria specified in this policy.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> By purchasing any Beacon Momentum program or service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to this Refund Policy. All sales are considered final unless you qualify for a refund under the terms described below.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Program-Specific Refund Terms</h2>
        <p>Refund eligibility varies by program type. Please review the terms applicable to your purchase.</p>

        <h3>2.1 Educational Programs (Beacon Rise, Beacon Launch, Beacon Academy)</h3>
        <p><strong>30-Day Money-Back Guarantee:</strong> We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee for our educational programs. If you are not satisfied with the program, you may request a full refund within 30 days of your initial purchase date, provided you meet the following conditions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have completed less than 25% of the program content</li>
            <li>You have not downloaded or accessed more than 25% of course materials</li>
            <li>You submit a refund request in writing to <a href="mailto:support@beaconmomentum.com">support@beaconmomentum.com</a></li>
            <li>You provide brief feedback explaining why the program was not a good fit</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>After 30 Days:</strong> Refunds are not available after 30 days from the date of purchase, except in cases of technical issues that prevent access to the program and cannot be resolved by our support team.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Mentorship Services (Digital Grandpa)</h3>
        <p><strong>First-Session Satisfaction Guarantee:</strong> If you are not satisfied after your first mentorship session, you may request a full refund within 14 days of that session. To qualify:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You must have attended the first scheduled session</li>
            <li>You must submit a refund request within 14 days of the first session</li>
            <li>You have not scheduled or attended additional sessions</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Monthly Subscriptions:</strong> For monthly mentorship subscriptions, you may cancel at any time, but refunds are not provided for partial months. Your access will continue until the end of the current billing period.</p>
        <p><strong>After First Session:</strong> Once you have attended more than one session or the 14-day window has passed, refunds are not available. You may cancel your subscription to prevent future charges, but no refund will be issued for the current billing period.</p>

        <h3>2.3 Done-For-You Technology Services (Beacon Labs)</h3>
        <p><strong>Milestone-Based Refunds:</strong> For done-for-you technology services, refunds are calculated based on project milestones:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Before work begins:</strong> Full refund minus a 10% administrative fee</li>
            <li><strong>After initial discovery/planning (0-25% complete):</strong> 75% refund</li>
            <li><strong>After development begins (25-50% complete):</strong> 50% refund</li>
            <li><strong>After 50% completion:</strong> No refund available</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Completion percentage is determined by Beacon Labs based on project scope, deliverables completed, and time invested.</p>

        <h3>2.4 Community Memberships</h3>
        <p><strong>Monthly Memberships:</strong> You may cancel your membership at any time. No refunds are provided for partial months, but your access will continue until the end of the current billing period.</p>
        <p><strong>Annual Memberships:</strong> Annual memberships are eligible for a prorated refund within the first 60 days. After 60 days, no refunds are available, but you may cancel to prevent auto-renewal.</p>

        <h3>2.5 Founding Member Lifetime Access</h3>
        <p><strong>Limited Refund Window:</strong> Founding Member lifetime access purchases are eligible for a full refund within 14 days of purchase, provided you have not accessed more than 10% of available content or attended any live events.</p>
        <p><strong>After 14 Days:</strong> Founding Member purchases are non-refundable after 14 days due to the significant discount and lifetime access provided.</p>
