## MISSION ACCOMPLISHED

Your core brand identity has been fully restored across the Beacon Momentum website. The **Lighthouse** theme with "Lighting the Way Forward" and the **Phoenix Rising from the Ashes** theme are now prominently featured and integrated throughout.

---

## WHAT WAS RESTORED

### 1. "Lighting the Way Forward" Tagline

**Homepage:**
- ✅ **Added to header logo** - Tagline now appears beneath "Beacon Momentum" in gold italic text
- ✅ **Capitalized in footer** - Changed from "Lighting the way forward" to "Lighting the Way Forward"
- ✅ **Updated description** - Changed "recovery support" to "rebuilding support" for consistency

**Visual Implementation:**
```
[Lighthouse Icon] Beacon Momentum
                  Lighting the Way Forward
```

**Result:** The tagline is now prominently displayed on every page load, reinforcing the lighthouse/guiding light brand identity.

---

### 2. Phoenix Rising Theme for Rise & Reclaim

**What Was Missing:** ZERO mentions of "phoenix" anywhere on the page. No rising, no ashes, no transformation metaphor.

**What Was Restored:**

#### Hero Section:
- ✅ **Added subtitle:** "🔥 PHOENIX RISING FROM THE ASHES 🔥" in gold with flame emojis
- ✅ **Transformed hero copy:** 
  - Old: "Join a supportive community of people rebuilding meaningful lives..."
  - New: "Your lowest moment isn't your final chapter—it's the fire that forges your transformation. Join a community of people rising from their ashes..."

#### Mission Section (Now "Your Phoenix Moment"):
- ✅ **Changed title** from "Our Mission" to "Your Phoenix Moment"
- ✅ **Integrated phoenix metaphor:**
  - "Every phoenix must pass through fire before it can rise"
  - "Your hardest moment...wasn't meant to destroy you. It was the fire that burns away what no longer serves you"
  - "Rise & Reclaim is where you rise from those ashes"
  - "Not back to who you were, but forward into who you're becoming"

**Result:** The Phoenix Rising theme is now the central metaphor of the entire Rise & Reclaim page, creating emotional resonance and clear brand differentiation.
