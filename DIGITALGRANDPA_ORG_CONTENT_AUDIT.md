## Migration Recommendations

### Content TO MIGRATE to Beacon digital-grandpa.html:

✅ **Bob's full story timeline** - Add to "Meet Bob Burr" section  
✅ **Testimonials** - Add to social proof section  
✅ **Success metrics** (94%, 87%, 76%) - Add credibility  
✅ **"Sometimes you don't need a guru" positioning** - Strong brand voice  
✅ **Free resources as lead magnets** - Can reference but link to GHL funnels  

### Content NOT TO MIGRATE:

❌ **Paid digital products** - Not part of Beacon business model  
❌ **E-commerce functionality** - Beacon uses Stripe for memberships only  
❌ **Complete Library bundle** - Different monetization strategy  

### Content TO RECONCILE:

⚠️ **Years of experience** - Standardize to 25+ years across all properties  
⚠️ **"Digital Grandpa" vs "Mentorship"** - Maintain "Digital Grandpa" as Bob's personal brand within Beacon ecosystem  
⚠️ **GraceHouse references** - Ensure consistent historical context

## Archival Strategy

### Option 1: Full Archive (Recommended)
- Keep DigitalGrandpa.org as historical archive
- Add banner: "Digital Grandpa is now part of Beacon Momentum"
- Redirect CTAs to Beacon Momentum programs
- Maintain for SEO and existing backlinks

### Option 2: Redirect Domain
- 301 redirect DigitalGrandpa.org → beaconmomentum.com/digital-grandpa.html
- Lose existing content but consolidate traffic
- Risk: Lose SEO value and existing rankings

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Best)
- Keep DigitalGrandpa.org live with "Join the Movement" banner
- Link to Beacon Momentum for programs
- Maintain as content hub and lead generation
- Update contact info and CTAs to point to Beacon
